				Tinderbox Alley is a theatre company which also produces, creates, evaluates and consults on arts projects.
				We are particularly interested in work which responds to the world, 
				discovering new connections and bringing together people from different backgrounds, cultures and places.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our work crosses cultural, national and disciplinary boundaries, and encourages collaboration between writers, artists, scientists, and historians. 
				Through the Theatrescience project we have led the way in challenging the boundaries between theatre and science.
				Young people are an integral part of our projects, helping to guide and inform at every stage, 
				and we regularly work with groups of young writers, theatre makers and schools to develop emerging talents and relationships.
			</p>
			<p>				
				We have produced and directed theatre productions, events and conferences in the UK and in India, Uganda, Ghana, and Hong Kong. 
				We have extensive experience of devising and leading workshops and creating education resources, and have produced new plays across the UK and India. 
				We have worked with, among others, the Royal Shakespeare Company, The Welsh Government, The Wellcome Trust, The British Council, National Theatre Wales, 
				National Centre for Biological Sciences, India, Imperial College London, and Jagriti Theatre, Bangalore.
