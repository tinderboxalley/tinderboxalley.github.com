					<h2>Dylan Thomas 100</h2>
					<p>In February 2012 the Parthian/Tinderbox Consultancy Team (Jess, Rebecca, Richard Davies and Jon Gower) 
					were engaged by the Welsh Government Major Events Unit to produce a Creative Vision for the centenary celebrations of Dylan Thomas's birth in 2014.</p>

					<p>Through a process of consulting key stakeholders and learning about Dylan Thomas' life and work, we drew up a creative vision of a celebration of Dylan Thomas' life and work which showcases Wales as a place of natural beauty, home of literary and creative excellence, looking towards the future and out to the wider world.</p> 
					<p>This included devising four guiding themes. Between the Covers of Books (Education and Learning), To Wales in My Arms (Tourism), Sailed and Set Dazzling (International), High Hill and Green Fuse Events intended to structure and inspire festival activity.</p> 
					<p>It included recommendations for selecting and commissioning events and outlined criteria which could be used to judge and assess applications for funding. The report brought coherence and shape to programming planning, providing a context for the good ideas that already exist, and providing inspiration for new and innovative ideas. 
					It is now in use as the basis for <a href="http://www.artswales.org.uk/what-we-do/funding/dt100">the Arts Council of Wales' commissioning process</a>.</p> 
					<p>The Creative Vision was launched at the Hay Festival in June 2012 to a high-profile audience of attendees including Hannah Ellis (Dylan's granddaughter and Patron of DT100) and Huw Lewis, Welsh Government Housing, Regeneration and Heritage Minister. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-18347283">BBC News story</a>
