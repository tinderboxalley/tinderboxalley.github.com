			<h2>I, Cinna (the poet)</h2>

			It is a  performance, starring Jude Owusu as Cinna (The Poet).</p>
			<p>As well as live performances taking place in the Swan theatre in the RSC's home in Stratford-upon-Avon, alongside the production of Julius Caesar, 
			the performance was broadcast over the web to schools across the UK on 2 July 2012.</p>
			<p>Rebecca ran the project for the RSC as Producer for the Film and Live Broadcast.</p> 
			<p>Jessica produced education resources on Julius Caesar, Roman history and culture, 
			and political action and participation. These were published alongside Tim Crouch's playtext by Oberon Books. 
			She also created the content for the website in collaboration with Ravensbourne students, 
			and wrote the scripts for two short films of Julius Caesar created by the animator Tom Cross.</p>
