			<h2>Half ‘n’ Half: The Curry Musical</h2>
			<h2>Research and Development</h2>
			<p>It’s 1986 and the ‘Taj Mahal Tandoori Restaurant and Take Away’ is just 
				one of many similar establishments in Cowbridge Road, Cardiff.</p>
			<p>The food is good: at least according to Fat Frank, their best customer,
				who eats there every day of the week, and twice on Saturdays. 
				But head waiter Rafiq is eccentric to say the least, 
				and the décor is still stuck in the seventies with no money to do the place
				up. Ali the proprietor despairs of ever making enough money to retire and 
				return to his family in Bangladesh. But his life is disrupted by the arrival 
				of a long-lost cousin and the mysterious ‘Balti Boys from Brum’…</p>
			<p>Half ‘n’ Half: The Curry Musical is a new musical which celebrates the unique 
				fusion of Anglo/Asian culture that can be found in the curry houses on every 
				high street in Britain.</p>
			<p>The draft libretto has been written by <a href="http://www.tim-riley.co.uk">Tim Riley</a>,
				a writer and composer who has worked as a composer-in-residence with Welsh National Opera
				and has written incidental music and songs for a number of plays on Radio Four, 
				as well as being shortlisted for the Vivian Ellis Prize for New Musicals.</p>
			<p>For most British people going for a curry is a normal part of life, 
				but very few ever get to see what is going on behind the kitchen door. 
				As part of the research for this project, Tim spent many months working 'behind the scenes' 
				in the kitchens of 'The Cinnamon Tree' Indian restaurant in Pontcanna, getting to know the 
				British Bangladeshi men who work there and learning more about their stories, hopes and aspirations.</p>
			<p>The project is now moving into a more collaborative stage with co-producers Rebecca Gould and Abdul Shayek 
				(National Theatre Wales). A development week is planned for May 2013, with plans to work with a 
				British Asian composer to create a unique musical score.</p> 
			<p>The aim is to perform the full version of Half ‘n’ Half at 
				Indian restaurant venues across Wales and the rest of the UK.</p>
