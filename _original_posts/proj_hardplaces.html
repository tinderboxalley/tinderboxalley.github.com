			<h2>Hard Places</h2>
			<p>The new play "Hard Places" by Farhad Sorabjee was produced at the Mercury Theatre Colchester in September 2012, before transferring to India where it played at the Prithvi International Theatre Festival, Mumbai, and in Cochin and New Delhi.</p>
			<p>Originally developed as part of the Royal Court Writer's Bloc International Programme, and published by Hachette India, this was its first full production. It was chosen by Lyn Gardner as a ‘theatre pick of the week’ in the Guardian.</p>
			<p><span class='quote'>‘performed with heartbreaking clarity and staged with perfect simplicity’</span> Colchester Gazette</p>
			<p><span class='quote'>‘Hard Places has the makings of a classic play. It mixes politics and family affairs to create an emotional rollercoaster.’</span> New India Express, Kochi</p>
			<p>The project is a co-production between Tinderbox Alley, the RAGE Foundation Mumbai and the Mercury Theatre Colchester. RAGE runs India’s only New Writing programme, through which 32 new plays have been produced, and the highly successful Writers' Bloc festival.</p>
			<p>Hard Places is inspired by the situation in "The Shouting Valley" in the Golan Heights, where families had to communicate across no-man's-land using megaphones, but explores the space of the imagination. A brother and sister, Aziz and Saira, are plotting to rescue their mother from the far side of the border. In a claustrophobic hotel room, they invent codes to trick the soldiers who watch over them. But when the time comes for confrontation, nothing is quite what it seems.</p>
			<p>Integrated with the play was a cross-cultural writing project for young people. Workshops were run with promising young writers aged 16-25 in both Mumbai and Colchester, and the best pieces were showcased alongside the performances in both countries. This process created a unique opportunity to develop promising writers in the UK and India, and to allow these writers to reflect on and write about the frequent reality of communities being divided.</p>
			<p>This project was made possible through the generosity of the Arts Council of England, an anonymous donation, the Indian Council for Cultural Relations and the BAJAJ Group.</p>
