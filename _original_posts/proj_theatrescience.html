					<h2>Theatrescience Projects</h2>
					<p>From 2002 to 2011, one of Tinderbox's primary projects was Theatrescience, co-founded by Rebecca and theatre director Jeff Teare. 
					Theatrescience brings together scientists, clinicians and theatre makers to create new drama inspired by and casting new light 
					on biomedical science. </p>

					<p>Projects included 
					"Not My Fault", for which three new plays (plus three pieces by young writers) 
					on the theme of genetic determinism were produced for the Eden Project, 
					"Acting Against Worms", working with students and teachers in Uganda on drama which communicated health messages about Schistosomiasis, 
					"Theatre of Science" at Theatre Royal Plymouth, and 
					"Imagining the Future", a series of events, workshops and new plays in the UK and India. </p>

					<p>Theatrescience continues to be an active project under the management of Jeff Teare, 
					run separately from Tinderbox, but often working together, with several new plays and projects in the pipeline.
