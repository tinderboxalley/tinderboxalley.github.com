					<h2>"Telling Stories"</h2>
					<h3>International Public Engagement Conference</h3>
					<p>In 2009 Rebecca and Jess were contracted by the Wellcome Trust to deliver their International Public Engagement Conference in Bangalore, India. 
					This eight-day workshop and festival brought together an exciting group of experts from across a diverse range of disciplines to explore the power of 
					storytelling in engaging the public with science. This interdisciplinary and intercultural meeting was a unique and memorable event and made real progress in learning how to engage the public with science in exciting new ways. 
					We chose the theme of storytelling - how narrative matters in public engagement with 
					science to focus on the power of stories to engage audiences emotionally as well as intellectually with scientific ideas. 
					</p>
					<p>
					At the conference, 100 delegates from more than 20 countries, including research scientists, journalists, arts practitioners, policymakers, and young people, gathered to share their experiences of engaging the public with science and to learn new creative ways to tell stories using art, music, drama, and more.
					"The informality and the way in which the sessions were unstructured helped a great deal in making the discussions rich and informative, 
					as somebody said in the conclusion session we can always go back to theory and our books for knowledge but the quality of discussions 
					we had because of the way in which sessions were conducted was of great help." Raj Panda, Public Health Specialist- RCH/Adjunct Assistant Professor, IIPH-Delhi, Public Health Foundation of India
					"Dear Rebecca - I'm just back from India and wanted to thank you and Jess again for all your incredible hard work for the workshop. I found it an incredibly stimulating gathering." Wendy J. Graham, Professor of Obstetric Epidemiology, University of Aberdeen
